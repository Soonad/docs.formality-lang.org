Welcome to Formality's documentation!
=====================================

Formality is an optimal functional programming language featuring theorem
proving. It is similar to Agda and Idris in functionality, but takes a different
approach to termination and induction: instead of a somewhat "hard-coded"
structural recursion checker, it is based on Elementary Affine Logic, which
gives it an elegant halting argument and complexity class, as well as great
properties such as optimal substitutions, no garbage-collection, and an
expressive type-theory with self-encoded inductive datatypes. To get a feel for
how the language looks, please take a look at files such as `Data.Bool.fm
<https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/blob/master/Data.Bool.fm>`_,
`Data.List.fm
<https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/blob/master/Data.List.fm>`_,
`Control.Functor.fm
<https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/blob/master/Control.Functor.fm>`_ or
`Relation.Equality.fm
<https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/blob/master/Relation.Equality.fm>`_
from `Formality-Base <https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base>`_, our official
standard libraries.
