Welcome to Formality's documentation!
=====================================

Formality is an optimal functional programming language featuring theorem proving. It is similar to Agda and Idris in functionality, but takes a different approach to termination and induction: instead of native datatypes with structural recursion, it uses Î»-encodings, self-types and relies on a different underlying logic, "elementary affine", which gives it an elegant halting argument. This gives it some unique properties such as optimal substitutions, practical efficiency, and an elegant underlying theory.
