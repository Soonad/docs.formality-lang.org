Welcome to Formality-Core's documentation!
==========================================

Formality-Core (FMC) is a minimal, efficient functional programming language designed to be a "low-level" compile-target for more feature-rich functional languages. Differently from most functional languages, FMC has amazing computational characteristics such as not requiring a garbage-collector, beta-reduction being a constant-time operation, being able to perform dynamic fusion, being strongly normalizing and massively parallelizable. In other words, FMC is really, really fast, and aims to be the ultimate assembly of resource-aware functional languages.
