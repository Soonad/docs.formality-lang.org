## Datatypes

Formality includes a powerful datatype system. A new datatype can be defined with the `T` syntax, which is similar to Haskell's `data`, and creates global definitions for its type and constructors. To pattern-match against a value of a datatype, you must use `case/T`.

### Simple datatypes

A simple datatype is equivalent to an enum. It can be defined and used as:

```javascript
import Base@0 open

T Suit
| clubs
| diamonds
| hearts
| spades

print_suit : {suit : Suit} -> Output
  case/Suit suit
  | clubs    => print("First rule: you do not talk about Fight Club.")
  | diamonds => print("Queen shines more than diamond.")
  | hearts   => print("You always had mine.")
  | spades   => print("The only card I need is the Ace of Spades! \m/")
  : Output

main : Output
  print_suit(spades)
```

The program above creates a datatype, `Suit`, with 4 cases (constructors). It then pattern-matches a suit and outputs a different sentence depending on it. The `case` expression requires he name of the matched datatype, the matched value, each case provided with a `|`. It also requires you to annotate the type returned by the match. This is important for dependent pattern matches. Since here it coincides with the type returned by the function, you can use `case`'d arguments instead:

```javascript
print_suit : {case suit : Suit} -> Output
| clubs    => print("First rule: you do not talk about Fight Club.")
| diamonds => print("Queen shines more than diamond.")
| hearts   => print("You always had mine.")
| spades   => print("The only card I need is the Ace of Spades! \m/")
```

Notice the `case` keyword before `suit`. This tells Formality to match `suit` directly, giving `print_suit` a Haskell-like syntax. This feature is actually quite powerful, as it will perform some handy resource management and "motive-filling" under the hoods, allowing you to write much smaller programs/proofs. Use it when possible!

### Container datatypes

Datatype constructors can have fields, allowing them to store values:

```javascript
T Vector3D
| v3 {x : Word, y : Word, z : Word}
```

You can access its fields with a `case` syntax:

```javascript
get_x : {v : Vector3D} -> Word
  case/Vector3D v
  | v3 => x
  : Word
```

#### Nested cases

When you have nested cases, you disambiguate with `^`, which refers to an outer variable:

```javascript
sum : {v0 : Vector3D, v1 : Vector3D} -> Vector3D
  case/Vector3D v0
  | v3 => case/Vector3D v1
    | v3 => v3(x + x^, y + y^, z + z^)
    : Vector3D
  : Vector3D
```

Or you can use `let`:

```javascript
sum : {a : Vector3D, b : Vector3D} -> Vector3D
  case/Vector3D a
  | v3 =>
    let ax = x
    let ay = y
    let az = z
    case/Vector3D b
    | v3 =>
      let bx = x
      let by = y
      let bz = z
      v3(ax + bx, ay + by, az + bz)
    : Vector3D
  : Vector3D
```

Of, preferably, just use `case`'d arguments. It'll allow you to access the fields with `var.field`, as in:

```javascript
sum : {case a : Vector3D, case b : Vector3D} -> Vector3D
| v3 v3 => v3(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y, a.z + b.z)
```

As you can see, `case`'d arguments will often be much terser than case-expressions.

### Recursive datatypes

Datatypes can contain fields of the same type. An example is `Nat`:

```javascript
T Nat
| succ {pred : Nat}
| zero

// Returns 1 if n > 0, otherwise returns 0
signal : {case n : Nat} -> Nat
| succ => succ(zero)
| zero => zero
```

Since Nat in particular is so common, there is a syntax-sugar for it: `0n3`, which expands to `succ(succ(succ(zero)))`.

#### Recursive functions

Of course, recursive datatypes aren't very useful without recursive functions. Since the underlying calculus behind Formality is terminating, you can't write those directly, as in:

```javascript
mul2 : {case n : Nat} -> Nat
| succ => succ(succ(mul2(n)))
| zero => zero
```

Instead, you must 1. append a `!` to its name and type, to make a "boxed definition", 2. annotate it with an extra variable, `N`, that tracks of the number of calls, 3. add a "halt-case" with `*`, which will be forcedly returned if the function "runs out of gas":

```javascript
!mul2*N : !{case n : Nat} -> Nat
| succ => succ(succ(mul2(n)))
| zero => zero
* zero
```

Then you can use it inside other boxed definitions by setting a maximum number of calls with `*`:

```javascript
!main : !Nat
  <mul2*65536>(succ(succ(zero)))
```

Or you can hide the number and Formality will default to a number so big it can never be reached in practice.

The reason things are this way is that recursive functions are desugared to eliminations of the inductive hypothesis of Church-encoded `Nat`s, which is the closest to recursion that the underlying theory offers, but requires a max number of calls and a "halt-case".  Note that 1. this results in no loss of performance, 2. Formality functions can have bounds so high that they'll never be reached in practice. So, from a practical point of view, Formality is no less powerful than, say, JavaScript, which is limited by the max stack size, your computer's memory/CPU, etc.

In any case, you don't need to understand any of that to use the language. Just remember that recursive functions have a slightly different syntax. For the nerds around, we'll explain those interesting details in later sections.

### Polymorphic datatypes

Polymorphic datatypes allow us to create multiple instances of the same datatype with different contained types.

```javascript
import Base@0 open

T Vector3D {T : Type}
| v3 {x : T, y : T, z : T} 

main : [:Nat, Word]
  let a = v3(~Nat, 0n1, 0n2, 0n3)
  let b = v3(~Word, 1, 2, 3)

  let ax = case/Vector3D a | v3 => x : Nat
  let bx = case/Vector3D b | v3 => x : Word

  [ax, bx]
```

The program above creates two 3D vectors, the first one storing `Nat`s and the second one storing `Word`s. The polymorphic variable `T`, defined with the `{}` syntax, allowed us to reuse the same definition of `Vector3D` for both contained types. With this, we can also create the popular functional `List` type:

```javascript
T List {T : Type}
| cons {head : T, tail : List(T)}
| nil

// Returns all but the first element
tail : {~T : Type, case list : List(T)} -> List(T)
| cons => list.tail
| nil  => nil(~T)

main : List(Word)
  tail(~Word, cons(~Word, 1, cons(~Word, 2, cons(~Word, 3, nil(~Word)))))
```

Notice that, since Formality has no implicict arguments, you need to explicitly instantiate constructors with `(~Word)`. To reduce the noise, you can use `let`:

```javascript
main : List(Word)
  let tail = tail(~Word)
  let cons = cons(~Word)
  let nil  = nil(~Word)
  tail(cons(1, cons(2, cons(3, nil))))
```

But, since `List` is so common, there is a built-in syntax-sugar for it, the dollar sign:

```javascript
main : List(Word)
  tail(~Word, Word$[1, 2, 3])
```

### Indexed datatypes

Indexes are like polymorphic variables, except that they can change as the structure grows. For example, a `Vector` is like a List, except that its type stores its own length:

```javascript
import Base@0 open

T Vector {T : Type} (len : Nat)
| vcons {~len : Nat, head : T, tail : Vector(T, len)} (succ(len))
| vnil                                                (zero)

main : Vector(String, 0n3)
  vcons(~String, ~0n2, "ichi",
  vcons(~String, ~0n1, "ni",
  vcons(~String, ~0n0, "san",
  vnil(~String))))
```

The `()` syntax was used to apply the indexes to the returned type of each constructor. For example, `| vnil (zero)` would be equivalent to `vnil : Vector(T, zero)` in Agda. In this example, `main` has the type `Vector(String, 0n3)`, meaning it is a vector with exactly 3 strings. If we used `vcons` again, the type would change to `Vector(String, 0n4)`. This feature allows us to annotate our data with very rich static information, allowing us to prevent a wide range of bugs. For example, here is a `vhead` function that can only be called in non-empty vectors:

```javascript
import Base@0 open

T Vector {T : Type} (len : Nat)
| vcons {~len : Nat, head : T, tail : Vector(T, len)} (succ(len))
| vnil                                                (zero)

vhead : {~T : Type, ~n : Nat, vector : Vector(T, succ(n))} -> T
  case/Vector vector
  | vcons  => head
  | vnil   => 1337
  : case/Nat len
    | succ => T
    | zero => Word
    : Type

main : Output
  let vec =
    vcons(~String, ~0n2, "uno",
    vcons(~String, ~0n1, "dos",
    vcons(~String, ~0n0, "tres",
    vnil(~String))))

  print(vhead(~String, ~0n2, vec))
```

To understand how it works, notice that the return-type of the `case` expression is allowed to access `len`. This allows Formality to specialize the expected type of each case. On `vcons`, the length is `succ(...)`, so we must provide an element of type `T`. On `vnil`, the length is `zero`, so we must provide any arbitrary `Word`. Then, the return type of the case expression itself is computed based on the index of the matched `vector`, which is `succ(n)`. Since that is positive, the return type is always `T`, i.e., Formality knows it will never fall on the `vnil` case. Calling `vhead` with an empty vector is impossible because we'd need an `n` such that `succ(n)` is `zero`, but there is no such natural number. 

Of course, since the length annotation is used only for type-checking purposes, computing it at runtime would be wasteful. That's why we use `~`. This allows the length to be dropped from the compiled output, avoiding any extra runtime cost.

### Self-Encodings

Interestingly, none of the features above are part of Formality's type theory. Instead, they are lightweight syntax-sugars that elaborate to plain-old lambdas. To be specific, a datatype is encoded as is own inductive hypothesis, with "self-types". For example, the `Bool` datatype desugars to:

```javascript
Bool : Type
  $self
  { ~P    : {x : Bool} -> Type
  , true  : P(true)
  , false : P(false)
  } -> P(self)

true : Bool
  new(~Bool){~P, true, false} true

false : Bool
  new(~Bool){~P, true, false} false

case_of : {b : Bool, ~P : {x : Bool} -> Type, t : P(true), f : P(false)} -> P(b)
  (%b)(~P, t, f)
```

Here, `$self ...`, `new(~T) val` and `%b` are the type, introduction, and elimination of self-types, respectively. You can see how any datatype is encoded under the hoods by asking `fm` to evaluate its type, as in, `fm any_file.Bool` or `fm any_file.Nat`. While you probably won't need to deal with self-encodings yourself, knowing how they work is valuable, since it allows you to express types not covered by the built-in syntax.

**TODO**: write a brief explanation on how Self-Types work (although I think it should be self-explanatory from this example!).
