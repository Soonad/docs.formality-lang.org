## Box System

Formality's approach to termination is what makes it different from other proof languages like Agda, Idris and Coq. Instead of having native datatypes, structural recursion and so on, we go deeper and change the underlying logic of the system from intuitionist to elementary affine. This is responsible for all the claimed benefits of Formality: optimal reductions, no garbage-collection, massive parallelism, elegant inductive types and so on. But it comes with a huge tradeoff: our lambdas are affine, i.e., bound variables can't be used more than once. This limits what we can do in multiple ways. For example, we can't write a function that `and`s a `Bool` with itself:

```javascript
import Base@0

self_and : {x : Bool} -> Bool
  and(x, x)

main : Bool
  self_and(true)
```

If we try to check the type using `fm -t <file_name>/main`, we get an error:

```shell
Lambda variable `x` used more than once in:
{x} => and(x, x)
```

This can be amended in multiple ways.

### Avoid making a copy.

If the "duplicated" variable is used in different branches, as in:

```javascript
import Base@0

// Negates `b` if `a` is true
not_if : {a : Bool, b : Bool} -> Bool
  case/Bool a
  | true  => not(b)
  | false => b
  : Bool

main : Bool
  not_if(true, true)
```

Then, we can avoid copying `b` with a clever trick: return a lambda on each branch. Like this:

```javascript
import Base@0

// Negates `b` if `a` is true
not_if : {a : Bool, b : Bool} -> Bool
  (case/Bool a
  | true  => {b} not(b)
  | false => {b} b
  : Bool -> Bool)(b)

main : Bool
  not_if(true, true)
```

Notice that instead of using `b` directly, the `case/Bool` expression returns, in each case, a different lambda, which is then applied to a single `b`. This prevents using it more than once, and is allowed. This technique is extremelly important for Formality development. 

### Use case'd arguments.

While the trick above is powerful, it increases code complexity. Fortunatelly, if you use `case`'d arguments instead of `case/T` expressions, Formality will automatically do it for you. For example, this works:

```javascript
import Base@0

// Negates `b` if `a` is true
not_if : {case a : Bool, b : Bool} -> Bool
| true  => not(b)
| false => b

main : Bool
  not_if(true, true)
```

And is much less verbose than the solution above. In practice, this features allows you to use a variable once per branch of the function, instead of once per function.

### Make a manual copy.

For `Word`s in particular, there is a native `cpy` operation that copies it as many times as desired:

```javascript
square : {x : Word} -> Word
  cpy x = x
  x * x

main : Word
  square(7)
```

When a `Word` is an argument of a top-level function, then you don't even need to add `cpy`. Formality does it for you. I.e., this works:

```javascript
square : {x : Word} -> Word
  x * x

main : Word
  square(7)
```

For other types, you can write an auxiliary `copy` function:

```javascript
import Base@0

// An explicit copying function
copy_bool : {b : Bool} -> [:Bool, Bool]
  case/Bool b
  | true  => [true, true]
  | false => [false, false]
  : [:Bool, Bool]

and_itself : {b : Bool} -> Bool
  get [b0, b1] = copy_bool(b) // performs an explicit copy
  and(b0, b1)

main : Bool 
  and_itself(true)
```

This is also a very important technique. So, in short, when you need to use a variable more than once, this is what you should do:

1. Is it a `Word`? If so, just `cpy` it.

2. Is the usage in different branches? Then manually return lambdas (or use `case`'d arguments).

3. Otherwise, copy the structure with an explicit `copy` function.

### Use boxes

Formality has another primitive for deep-copying values, boxes.

syntax | description
--- | ---
`# a` | Puts the closed term `a` inside a box
`! A` | The type of a boxed term
`dup x = #a ...` | Removes `a` from its box and makes `n` copies of it as `x`

But this primitive, without restriction, would be very dangerous. For example, this program:

```javascript
main
  let f = {x}
    dup x = x
    x(#x)
  f(#f)
```

Would loop forever, which should never happen in a terminating language. To solve that, Formality relies on the **stratification condition**. It, in short, enforces the following invariant:

> The level a term can never change during the program evaluation.

Where the level of a term is the number of boxes (`#`s) wrapping it on the syntax tree. For example, here:

```javascript
["a", [#"b", #[#"c", ##"d"]]]
```

The string `"a"` isn't wrapped by any box. As such, it is on `level 0`. The string `"b"` is wrapped by one box, so it is on `level 1`. The entire `[#"c", ##"d"]` pair is wrapped by one box, so, `"c"` is wrapped by 2 boxes in total and, thus, is on `level 2`, while `"d"` is wrapped by 3 boxes in total and, thus, is on `level 3`. 

This condition forbids certain programs from being accepted. For example, this one:

```javascript
box : {x : Word} -> !Word 
  # x
```

Isn't allowed because, if it was, we would be able to increase the level of a word. Similarly, this one:

```javascript
main : [:Word, Word]
  dup x = #42
  [x, x]
```

Isn't allowed, because `42` would jump from `level 1` to `level 0` during runtime. But this one is fine:

```javascript
main : ![:Word, Word]
  dup x = #42
  # [x, x]
```

Because `42` remains on `level 1` after being copied. This one is fine too:

```javascript
main : [:!Word, !Word]
  dup x = #42
  [#x, #x]
```

For the same reason.

Because of this, boxes aren't really useful for copying data: information can only flow from lower to higher levels. That is, a term triggering a `dup` must be one level below the term copied, it won't be able to read the results of that copy. But boxes are very useful for implementing control structure: bounded loops, recursion, etc. In fact, Formality's recursive functions are actually desugared to an application of inductive Nats, which use boxes internally. Think of Formality's boxes as "the most flexible system for duplications one can afford without making the language non-terminating".

### Loops and Recursion

To show how bounded loops and recursion can be implemented with boxes, observe the following program:

```javascript
ten_times : {~T : Type, f : !{x : T} -> T, x : !T} -> !T
  dup f = f
  dup x = x
  # f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(x))))))))))

main : !Word
  ten_times(~Word, #{x} x + 2, #0)
```

Here, we define a function, `ten_times`, which takes a function, `f`, creates 10 copies of it, and applies to an argument, `x`. As the result, we're able to repeat the `+ 2` operation 10 times, adding `20` to `0`. This same technique can be used to implement bounded recursion. For example, here:

```javascript
ten_times : {~T : Type, f : !{x : T} -> T, x : !T} -> !T
  dup f = f
  dup x = x
  # f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(x))))))))))

fact : !{n : Word} -> Word
  let call = {rec, i}
    cpy i = i
    if i .= 0:
      1
    else:
      (i * rec(i - 1))
  let halt = {i}
    0
  ten_times(~{x : Word} -> Word, #call, #halt)

main : !Word
  dup fact = fact
  # fact(6)
```

We "emulate" a recursive function by using `ten_times` to "build" the recursion tree of "fact" up to 10 layers deep. As such, it only works for inputs up to 10; after that, it hits the "halt" case and returns 0. The good thing about this way of doing recursion is that we're not limited to recurse on structurally smaller arguments. The bad thing is that it is a little bit verbose, requiring an explicit bound, and a halting case for when the function "runs out of gas". Moreover, since we used `ten_times` to make the function, it comes inside a box, on `level 1`. In other words, it is impossible to use it on `level 0`! Instead, we must use the `level 0` to unbox it (with a `dup`), and then use it on `level 1`.

Fortunately, since bounded recursive functions are so common, Formality has built-in syntax for them, relying on "boxed definitions". To make a boxed definition, simply annotate it with a `!` instead of a `:`. That has several effects. First, the whole definition is lifted to `level 1`. Second, it allows you to use boxed definitions inside `<>`s: the parser will automatically unbox them for you. Third, the definition can call itself recursively; if it does, then Formality will assembling the recursion for you using a `Ind` implementation from the Base library. This is an example of usage:

```javascript
!fact*n : ! {i : Word} -> Word
  cpy i = i
  if i .= 0:
    1
  else:
    i * fact(i - 1)
  * 0
  
!main : !Word
  <fact*100>(12)
```

Notice that the halting case was defined with a `*` on the end. If it coincided with one of the function's arguments, you could place a `*` before it instead, i.e., `fact ! {*i : Word} -> Word`. Note also that, since `main` uses a recursive function, it must itself be a boxed definition, annotated with `!`. Alternatively, you could make it a normal definition and perform the unboxing yourself:

```javascript
main : !Word
  dup fact = fact*100
  # fact(12)
```

Both are equivalent.

The maximum recursion depth of the `Ind` defined by the base library is `2^256-1`. In other words, despite being terminating, in practice, Formality is capable of doing anything a Turing-complete language could do. After all, no language could perform more than `2^256-1` calls without exhausting your computer (or this universe's) resources.
