# Installation

Right now, Formality can only be installed through npm. Install npm following [this guide](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Then, go to the command-line and type:

```
npm i -g formality-lang
```

This should be all you need. In order to test if it worked, type `fm` on the terminal. If you see Formality's command-line options, then it has been successfully installed in your system. If you have any problem during this process, please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/moonad/Formality/issues).
