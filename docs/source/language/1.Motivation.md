# Motivation

Formality exists to fill a hole in the current market: there aren't many languages featuring *theorem proving* that are simple, user-friendly and efficient. To accomplish that goal, we rely on several design philosophies:

### An accessible, user-friendly syntax

Proof languages often have complex syntaxes that make them needlessly inaccessible, as if the subject wasn't hard enough already. Coq, for example, uses 3 different languages with different rules and an overall heavy syntax. Agda is clean and beautiful, but relies heavily on unicode and agda-mode, making it essentially unusable outside of EMACs, which is arguably a "hardcore" editor. Formality aims to keep a simple, familiar syntax that is much closer to common languages like Python and JavaScript. A regular TypeScript developer should, for example, be able to read our [Functor](https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/blob/master/Control.Functor.fm) formalization without extensive training. While we may not be quite there, we're making fast progress towards that goal.

### Fast "by design"

Some languages are inherently slow, by design. JavaScript, for example, is slower than C: all things equal, its mandatory garbage collector will be an unavoidable extra cost. Formality is meant to be as fast as theoretically possible, by design. For example, it has affine lambdas, allowing it to be garbage-collection-free. It has a strongly confluent interaction-net runtime, allowing it to be evaluated in massively parallel architectures. It doesn't require bruijn bookkeeping, making it the fastest "closure chunker" around. It is lazy, it has a clear cost model for blockchains, it is very small and easily compilable to JavaScript and other targets, and so on. Right now, Formality isn't as fast as mature languages with decades-old compilers, but it has endless room for improvements.

### An optimal high-order evaluator

Formality's substitution algorithm is **asymptotically faster** than Haskell's, Scheme's, JavaScript's and other closure implementations. This makes it extremely fast at evaluating high-order programs, combining a Haskell-like high-level feel with a Rust-like low-level performance curve. For example, Haskell's stream fusion, a hard-coded, important optimization, happens naturally, [at runtime](https://medium.com/@maiavictor/solving-the-mystery-behind-abstract-algorithms-magical-optimizations-144225164b07), on Formality. This also allow us to explore new ways to develop algorithms, such as this "impossibly efficient" [exp-mod implementation](https://medium.com/@maiavictor/calling-a-function-a-googol-times-53933c072e3a) implementation. Who knows if this may lead to new breakthroughs in complexity theory?

### An elegant underlying Type Theory

Formality's unique approach to termination is conjectured to allow it to have elegant, powerful type-level features that would be otherwise impossible without causing logical inconsistencies. For example, instead of built-in datatypes, we rely on [Self Types](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Self-Types-for-Dependently-Typed-Lambda-Encodings-Fu-Stump/652f673e13b889e0fd7adbd480c2fdf290621f66), which allow us to implement inductive families with native lambdas. As history tells, having elegant foundations often pays back. We've not only managed to port several proofs from other assistants, but found techniques to [emulate Coq's structural recursion](https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/commit/b777d806c6fa37f2ce306fbe87b3ed267152b90c), to perform large eliminations, and even an hypothetical encoding of [higher inductive types](https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/blob/master/Example.HigherInductiveType.fm); and we've barely began exploring the system.
