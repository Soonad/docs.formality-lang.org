# Basics

## Let

Formality includes `let` expressions, which allow you to give names to expression.

```javascript
main : String
  let hello = "Hello, world!"
  print(hello)
```

`let` expressions can be infinitely nested.

```javascript
main : String
  let output = 
    let hello = "Hello, world!"
    print(hello)
  output
```

`let` performs parse-time substitution. This means it can't be used for sharing/copying, as will become clear later on.

## Words

Formality includes native, unsigned, 32-bit numbers, and many numeric operations:

name | syntax | JavaScript equivalent
--- | --- | ---
addition | `x + y` | `(x + y) >>> 0`
subtraction | `x - y` | `(x - y) >>> 0`
multiplication | `x * y` | `(x * y) >>> 0`
division | `x / y` | `(x / y) >>> 0`
modulus | `x % y` | `(x % y) >>> 0`
exponentiation | `x ^ y` | `(x ** y) >>> 0`
bitwise-and | `x .& y` | `x & y`
bitwise-or | `x .| y` | `x | y`
bitwise-xor | `x .^ y` | `x ^ y`
bitwise-not | `x .! y` | `~y`
bitwise-right-shift | `x .>> y` | `x >>> y`
bitwise-left-shift | `x .<< y` | `x << y`
greater-than | `x .> y` | `x > y ? 1 : 0`
less-than | `x .< y` | `x < y ? 1 : 0`
equals | `x .= y` | `x === y ? 1 : 0`
float-addition | `x +f y` | `x + y`
float-subtraction | `x -f y` | `x - y`
float-multiplication | `x *f y` | `x * y`
float-division | `x /f y` | `x / y`
float-modulus | `x %f y` | `x % y`
float-exponentiation | `x ^f y` | `x ** y`
uint-to-float | `.f` | - 
float-to-uint | `.u` | -

The type of a native number is `Word`. Note that there is no operator precedence. An expression like `3 * 10 + 1` is always parsed as `3 * (10 + 1)`. You can use parenthesis to change the order.

```javascript
main : Word
  (3 * 10) + 1
```

## If

`if` allows branching with a `Word` condition.

syntax | description
--- | ---
`if n: a else: b` | If `n .= 0`, evaluates to `a`, else, evaluates to `b`

Usage is straightforward:

```javascript
main : Output
  let age = 30

  if age .< 18:
    print("boring teenager")
  else:
    print("respect your elders!")
```


## Pairs

Formality includes native pairs.

syntax | description
--- | ---
`[x : A, B(x)]` | The type of a pair
`[a, b]` | Creates a pair with elements `a` and `b`
`fst(p)` | Extracts the first element of a pair
`snd(p)` | Extracts the second element of a pair
`get [a, b] = p ...` | Extracts both elements of a pair

Note that the type of a pair is `[x : A, B(x)]`, because the type of the second element can depend on the value of the first. When it doesn't, you can write just `[:A, B]` instead. Using pairs is straightforward.

- Creating, extracting one element with `fst`

```javascript
main : Word
  let pair = [1, 2]
  fst(pair)
```

- Creating, extracting both elements with `get`

```javascript
main : Word
  let pair  = [1, 2]
  get [a,b] = pair
  a + b
```

- Nesting

```javascript
main : [:Word, Word]
  let pairs = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
  fst(pairs)
```
- Heterogenic
```javascript
main : [:[:Word,Word], String]
  [[1, 2], "Hello Word!"]
```

## Functions

Formality includes primitives for creating and applying functions:

syntax | effect
--- | ---
`{x : A, y : B, z : C, ...} -> D` | Function type with args `x : A`, `y : B`, `z : C`, returning `D`
`{x, y, z, ...} body` | A function that receives the arguments `x`, `y`, `z` and returns `body` 
`f(x, y, z, ...)` | Applies the function `f` to the arguments `x`, `y`, `z` (curried)

Formality functions are anonymous expressions, like Haskell's lambdas. It has no multi-argument lambdas; `{x, y, z, ...} body` is just a syntax-sugar for `{x} {y} {z} ... body`. This is the same as JavaScript's `x => y => z => ... body`, or Haskell's `\ x y z ... -> body`. Function calls use the more conventional `f(x, y, z)` syntax, which, since functions are curried, is just a syntax-sugar for `f(x)(y)(z)...`.

The type of a function is `{x : A, y : B, z : C ...} -> D`, which is equivalent to Agda's `(x : A) -> (y : B) -> (z : C) -> ... D`. As usual, function types can be shortened as `A -> B` when `x` is unused. When annotating a top-level definition with a functional type, you don't need to write the lambdas, they are added implicity. For example:

```javascript
birth_to_age : {birth : Word} -> Word
  2019 - birth

main : Word
  birth_to_age(1990)
```

Lambdas and applications can be erased with a `~`, which causes them to vanish from the compiled output. This is useful, for example, to write polymorphic functions without extra runtime costs. For example, this is the polymorphic identity function:

```javascript
id : {~T : Type, x : T} -> T
  x

main : Word
  id(~Word, 42)
```

## Local imports

The `import` statement can be used to include local files. For example, save an `Answers.fm` file in the same directory as `hello.fm`, with the following contents:

```javascript
import Base@0

everything : String
  "42"
```

Then save a `test.fm` file as:

```javascript
import Base@0
import Answers

main : Output
  print(everything)
```

And run it with `fm test/main`. You should see `42`.

If multiple imports have conflicting names, you can disambiguate with `File/name`, or with a qualified import, using `as`:


```javascript
import Base@0
import Answers as A

main : Output
  print(A/everything)
```

## Global imports

Formality also has a file-based package manager. You can use it to share files with other people. A file can be saved globally with `fm -s file`. This will give it a unique name with a version, such as `file@7`. Once given a unique name, the file contents will never change, so `file@7` will always refer to that exact file. As soon as it is saved globally, you can import it from any other computer. For example, remove `Answers.fm` and change `hello.fm` to:

```javascript
import Base@0
import Answers@0

main : Output
  print(everything)
```

This will load `Answers@0.fm` inside the `fm_modules` directory and load it. Any import ending with `@N` refers to a unique, immutable, permanent global file. That prevents the infamous "depencency hell", and is useful for many applications.

Right now, global imports are uploaded to our servers, but, in a future, they'll upload files to a decentralized storage such as IPFS/Swarm, and give it a unique name using Ethereum's naming system.
